          Timi is a conscientious and creative member of a team. She showed great effort to complete the given tasks in time and was not afraid to ask
          us whenever she had a question. She found the common voice easily with everyone, so was always a cheerful member of the team. Dividing the
          tasks is not easy, but she does it well by keeping in mind the other teammates skills. I think she will be a loyal and reliable junior
          developer you can count on. Szab√≥ Rudi (Mentor)
